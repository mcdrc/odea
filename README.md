Open Digital Ethnography Archives toolkit

This python toolkit is designed to operate with living collections of
ethnographic documents, organized using the simple BagIt standard.

The goal is to provide tools for automating the management of archival
documents -- storage, indexing, validation, conversion to distribution formats,
metadata cataloguing -- in ways that allow everything to remain accessible from
the computer file system and open to manipulation with standard tools.

Please see the documentation folder accompanying this project for details.
